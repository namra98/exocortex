# February 2026

## Summary

February started with a productive first week focused on auth infrastructure and the launch of the exocortex personal knowledge management project. This recap covers the month's progress.

## Key Themes

### 1. Auth Infrastructure
Designed and implemented auth token refresh using rotation pattern. Evaluated alternatives (silent refresh, BFF pattern). Integration tests passing. BFF prototype planned as a follow-up.

### 2. Personal Productivity System (Exocortex)
Started building a markdown + git personal notes system optimized for AI CLI assistants. Completed specification, implementation plan, and initial build. System includes daily logs, task tracking, idea capture, and weekly/monthly recaps.

### 3. AI Tooling Exploration
First hands-on experience with Copilot CLI and initial research into Claude CLI. Explored how AI agents can serve as persistent personal assistants beyond code generation.

## Month at a Glance

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| W06 (Feb 2-6) | Auth refresh implementation, exocortex kickoff |

## Tasks Completed This Month

- [x] Sprint backlog review and prioritization
- [x] Auth token refresh — design, implementation, testing
- [x] API versioning proposal review
- [x] Exocortex — spec, plan, initial implementation

## Ideas in Flight

| Idea | Status |
|------|--------|
| Copilot CLI as personal assistant | Exploring |
| Auth token refresh patterns (BFF) | Active |
| AI agent workflows for productivity | Exploring |

## Reflection

Good balance of delivery (auth) and exploration (exocortex, AI tools). The exocortex project has potential to compound — investing in personal knowledge management should pay dividends over time.
