# Copilot CLI as Personal Assistant

**Status**: exploring
**Created**: 2026-02-05

## Core Idea

Use Copilot CLI as a persistent personal assistant by combining it with a structured markdown knowledge base. Instead of remembering commands or file locations, speak naturally and let the AI handle storage and retrieval.

## Open Questions

- How well does it handle ambiguous commands? ("save this" — save what, where?)
- Can it learn preferences over time, or does the skill file need to cover everything?
- What's the latency like for large repos with many daily files?
