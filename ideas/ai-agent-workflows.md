# AI Agent Workflows for Productivity

**Status**: exploring
**Created**: 2026-02-02

## Core Idea

Explore how AI CLI agents (Copilot CLI, Claude CLI, etc.) can be woven into daily developer workflows — not just for code generation but for personal knowledge management, task tracking, and decision logging.

## Observations

- Current tools are great at code but weak at persistent memory
- Skill files / system prompts can bridge the gap
- Markdown + git gives versioning and portability for free
- The key unlock is making the AI aware of your file structure

## Experiments to Run

- [ ] Compare Copilot CLI vs Claude CLI for note-taking tasks
- [ ] Test multi-agent workflow: one for code, one for notes
- [ ] Try voice-to-text → AI → structured notes pipeline
