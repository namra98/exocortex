- Quick bug fix for a null pointer in the user profile endpoint

## Learning / Study
- [14:00] Installed and tested GitHub Copilot CLI — the agentic capabilities are impressive
- Experimented with using Copilot CLI for code explanation and refactoring tasks

## Ideas & Observations
- Copilot CLI could be great for managing personal notes and tasks — want to explore this further
- The skill file / instructions pattern means you can teach it custom workflows

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Write integration tests for token refresh
- [x] Deploy auth to staging
