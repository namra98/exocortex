## Summary
Designed and began implementing a personal notes and task management system using markdown + git, optimized for AI CLI assistants.

## Work
- Designed the notes system architecture: folder structure, file formats, skill file concept
- Ran full PAW workflow: spec → plan → implementation
- Chose markdown + git over OneNote for AI-agent compatibility and version history

## Ideas & Observations
- NOTES-SKILL.md pattern could work for other personal systems (finance tracking, reading lists)
- Copilot CLI as the "UI layer" for notes — natural language in, structured markdown out
- The skill file pattern means zero onboarding for new AI sessions

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Design notes system folder structure
- [x] Create initial spec and implementation plan via PAW workflow

## Tomorrow / Follow-up
- Complete NOTES-SKILL.md (the AI instruction file)
- Start using the system daily — capture ideas as they come
- Set up GitHub remote for backup
