## Summary
Mid-week push on auth work, plus a good team discussion about API versioning strategy.

## Work
- Added error handling and retry logic to token refresh
- Team meeting: decided on URL-based API versioning (v1, v2) over header-based
- Reviewed the database migration PR — looks good, minor comments

## Personal
- Scheduled dentist appointment for next week

## Ideas & Observations
- The API versioning discussion reminded me — we should document our API design conventions somewhere central

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Add error handling to token refresh
- [x] Review database migration PR

## Tomorrow / Follow-up
- Write integration tests for token refresh
- Start drafting API versioning guidelines
