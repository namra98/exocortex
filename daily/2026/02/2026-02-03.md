## Learning / Study
- [10:00] Read "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks" — fascinating approach to grounding LLM outputs
- Bookmarked 3 related papers for later

## Ideas & Observations
- RAG approach could be useful for our internal docs search tool — worth exploring (see ideas/ for related)

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Implement token refresh basic flow
- [x] Fix flaky CI test
